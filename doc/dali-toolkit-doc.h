 *
 * @brief DALi is a cross-platform 3D UI Toolkit for embedded systems.
 *
 * @section dali-overview Overview
 *
 * DALi's 3D user interface engine enables you to create rich and high-performance
 * UI applications. DALi is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, but provides a clean
 * cross-platform C++ framework.
 * This means that you can use high-level DALi APIs instead of accessing
 * low-level OpenGL APIs directly.
 *
 * DALi consists of the following modules:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 *    <th>Module</th>
 *    <th>Description</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>@ref dali_core</td>
 *    <td>DALi Core provides core functionalities such as scene graph-based rendering, animation, and event handling.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>@ref dali_adaptor</td>
 *    <td>DALi Adaptor is a platform adaptation layer.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>@ref dali_toolkit</td>
 *    <td>DALi Toolkit provides UI components and various effects on top of the DALi Core.</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
