/**
 * @brief ModelView is a control to show 3D model objects.
 * ModelView supports to load glTF 2.0 and DLI models for the input format
 * and also supports Physically Based Rendering with Image Based Lighting.
 *
 * The Animations defined in the glTF or DLI models are also loaded and can be retrieved by using GetAnimation() method.
 * The number of animation is also retrieved by GetAnimationCount() method.
 *
 * By default, The loaded model has it's own position and size which are defined in vertex buffer regardless of the Control size.
 * The model can be resized and repositioned to fit to the ModelView Control with FitSize() and FitCenter() methods.
