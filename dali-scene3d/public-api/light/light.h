/**
 * @brief This class is to define 3D Light source.
 * Currently this Light class supports Directional Light that lits every position from the same direction. (e.g, Sun light)
 * If a Light object is added on SceneView, the 3D objects in the SceneView are shined the Light.
 * DALi Scene3D limits the maximum enabled light count per each SceneView.
 * Currently the maximum number is set to 5, and it can be retrieved by using GetMaximumEnabledLightCount().
 * If more than 5 enabled Light objects are added on SceneView, SceneView turns on only 5 lights in the order the lights were added.
 * This Light can be added to SceneView directly but also it can be added on other Actor.
 * When a parent actor is added to a SceneView, its Light behaves in the SceneView the same as if it were added directly to the SceneView.
 * @note Light inherits Actor, so Light color and direction can be controlled by setting Actor's COLOR and ORIENTATION Property.
 * Dali::DevelActor::LookAt() method can be used to set light direction easily.
 * @note Default light direction is to Z-axis
 * @code
 * Scene3D::SceneView sceneView = Scene3D::SceneView::New();
 * Scene3D::Lightlight = Scene3D::Light::New();
 * light.SetProperty(Dali::Actor::Property::COLOR, Color::BROWN);
 * Dali::DevelActor::LookAt(light, Vector3(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f));
 * sceneView.Add(light);
