/**
 * Creates a new DistanceFieldEffect
 *
 * DistanceFieldEffect is a custom shader effect to achieve distance field on Image actors
 *
 * Animatable/Constrainable uniforms - These will need to be registered to the actor as a custom property to take into effect:
 *
 *  "uDoGlow"       - The glow state. If true, glow is enabled
 *  "uGlowBoundary" - The glow boundary factor
 *  "uGlowColor"    - The glow color multiplier

 *  "uDoShadow"     - The shadow state. If true, shadows is enabled. Cannot be used with glow/and or outline
 *  "uShadowColor"  - The shadow color multiplier
 *  "uShadowOffset" - The shadow offset

 *  "uDoOutline"    - The outline state. If true, outline is enabled
 *  "uOutlineColor" - The outline color multiplier
 *  "uOutlineParams"- Thickness of outline. The outline thickness is determined by two values.
 *                    First value [0-1] Specifies the distance field value for the center of the outline.
 *                    Second value [0-1] Specifies the softness/width/anti-aliasing of the outlines inner edge.
 *
 *  @return The newly created Property::Map with the distance field effect
