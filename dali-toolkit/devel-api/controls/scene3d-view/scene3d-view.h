/**
 *
 * Scene3dView is a class for containing scene elements loaded from scene format file(e.g., glTF). Scene elements mean scene graph, cameras, and animations.
 *
 * Basic idea:-
 *
 * 1) The Scene3dView is initialized with diffuse and specular cube map for the Image Based Lighting.\n
 *    If the Scene3dView initialized without cube map, the objects of the Scene3dView cannot be rendered with IBL.\n
 * 2) The Scene3dView is loaded from each scene format file(e.g., glTF).\n
 * 3) The Scene3dView can have a point light or a directional light.(optional)\n
 * 4) The Scene3dView playes each actor's animation.\n
 *
 *
 * Usage example: -
 *
 * @code
 *
 * void Scene3dViewExample::Create( Application& application )
 * {
 *   // Use 'Scene3dView::New( URL_SCENE_FILE )', if you don't want to render with IBL.
 *   Scene3dView scene3dView = Scene3dView::New( URL_SCENE_FILE, URL_DIFFUSE_TEXTURE, URL_SPECULAR_TEXTURE );
 *
 *   Stage::GetCurrent().Add( scene3dView );
 *   scene3dView.PlayAnimations();
 *
 *   scene3dView.SetLight( Scene3dView::LightType::DIRECTIONAL_LIGHT, Vector3( 1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ), Vector3( 0.3, 0.3, 0.3 ) );
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * @remarks This control makes 3D Layer internally. Therefore, if any 2D UI
 * control is added as a child of this Scene3dView, the functionality of the 2D UI
 * may not work well.
