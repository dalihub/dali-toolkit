/**
 * @brief
 * GaussianBlurView is a class for applying a render process that blurs an image.
 *
 * Basic idea:-
 *
 * 1) The GaussianBlurView object will render all its child actors offscreen.\n
 * 2) The GaussianBlurView object then blurs the result of step 1), using a two pass separated Gaussian blur.\n
 * 3) The GaussianBlurView object then composites the blur from step 2) with the child actors image from step 1). See GetBlurStrengthPropertyIndex() for more info.\n
 * 4) The GaussianBlurView object gets rendered automatically, either to the screen via the default render task, or via a RenderTask the user has created for
 * e.g. further offscreen rendering.
 *
 * Fundamentally, the GaussianBlurView is simply an Actor in the normal actor tree that affects all of its children. It should be added to your Actor tree and manipulated in the
 * normal ways. It can be considered a 'portal' in the sense that all child actors are clipped to the GaussianBlurView actor bounds.
 *
 * ************\n
 * NB: It is essential to remove the GaussianBlurView from the stage and also to call Deactivate() on it when you are not using it. This will ensure that resources are freed and
 * rendering stops.\n
 * ************\n
 *
 * Usage example:-
 *
 * @code
 *  // Initialise
 *  GaussianBlurView gaussianBlurView = GaussianBlurView::New();
 *
 *  // Create and add some visible actors to the GaussianBlurView, all these child actors will therefore get blurred.
 *  Image image = Image::New(...);
 *  ImageView imageView = ImageView::New(image);
 *  gaussianBlurView.Add(imageView);
 *  ...
 *
 *  // Start rendering the GaussianBlurView
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Add(gaussianBlurView);
 *  gaussianBlurView.Activate();
 *  ...
 *
 *  // Animate the strength of the blur - this can fade between no blur and full blur. See GetBlurStrengthPropertyIndex().
 *  Animation blurAnimation = Animation::New( ... );
 *  blurAnimation.AnimateTo( Property( gaussianBlurView, gaussianBlurView.GetBlurStrengthPropertyIndex() ), ... );
 *  blurAnimation.Play();
 *
 *  ...
 *  // Stop rendering the GaussianBlurView
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Remove(gaussianBlurView);
 *  gaussianBlurView.Deactivate();
 * @endcode
 * @SINCE_1_0.0
 * @remarks This is an experimental feature and might not be supported in the next release.
 * We do recommend not to use this class.
