 * TransitionSet is used to control lifetime of multiple Transitions.

 * For the case, it is more useful to manage a group of transitions with same lifetime and a finished signal.
 * TransitionSet provides a single Play call and Finished callback for the multiple traisitions those added on it.
 *
 * @note
 * Do not add transitions for a View by dividing them into multiple TransitionSets.
